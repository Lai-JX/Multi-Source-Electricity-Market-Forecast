# Multi-Source-Electricity-Market-Forecast

The project is based on a time-series model combined with a federal learning framework for electricity load forecasting in multi-source electricity markets.

And we will build the final model by conducting differtent routes. Here are the differtent routes.

* Data Collection & Background Research
* Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
* Build an electricity load forecasting model 
* Federated Learning Framework on Privicy
* Combining Federated Learning and Forecastring models
* Model Synthesis Analysis & Issue a paper

This project officially started in early September 2022 and will be continuously updated and optimized.
